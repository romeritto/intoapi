IntoParty API

Since the project is pretty small I used only one app and no additional frameworks in order to keep it simple. The only "stolen code" is the breadcrumbs templatetag snippet made by drozzy (https://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1289/). Well, I regret it a bit, because I had to face quite a few integration errors.
