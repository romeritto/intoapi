# IntoParty API 

In order to run the project, you need to change the path **VIRTUAL_ENV** in **env/bin/activate** to your actual path.

Since the project is pretty small I used only one app and no additional frameworks in order to keep it simple. The only "stolen code" is the [breadcrumbs templatetag](https://www.djangosnippets.org/snippets/1289/) snippet made by drozzy. Well, I regret it a bit, because I had to face quite a few integration errors.
